## Build Instructions
### Windows
1. Download and Install Node from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ (LTS is usually a good choice)
2. `git clone https://github.com/AstroDogeDX/CVRX.git`
3. `cd CVRX`
4. `npm install`
5. `npm run make`

This should create the `CVRX-x.x.x Setup.exe` in the folder: `out/make/squirrel.windows/x64/CVRX-x.x.x Setup.exe`

(Note: Mac OS & Linux - build instructions should be the same, but the output file will correspond to your target platform)
